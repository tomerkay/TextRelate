JERUSALEM, Israel - Sharon Tendler met Cindy 15 years ago.

She said it was love at first sight.

Last week she finally took the plunge and proposed.

In a modest ceremony at Dolphin Reef in the southern Israeli port of Eilat, Tendler, a 41-year-old British citizen, apparently became the world's first person to "marry" a dolphin.

Dressed in a white dress, a veil and pink flowers in her hair, Tendler got down on one knee on the dock and gave Cindy a kiss.

"It's not a perverted thing, I do love this dolphin, He's the love of my life," she said yesterday, upon her return to London.

Tendler, who said she imports clothes and promotes rock bands in England, has visited Israel several times a year since first meeting the dolphin.

While she acknowledged the "wedding" had no legal bearing she did say it reflected her deep feelings toward the bottlenosed, 35-year-old object of her affection.

"It's not a bad thing. 

It's just something that we did because I love him, but not in the way that you love a man. 

"It's just a pure love that I have for this animal," she said.
