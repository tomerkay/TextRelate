A Jewish millionaire from London has married a male dolphin this week, according to reports.

Sharon Tendler, 41, and 35-aged male dolphin Cindy wed in Israel's Eliat resort Wednesday. 

Tendler had received the approval of Cindy's trainer Maya Zilber for the unusual ceremony.

Tendler met Cindy fifteen years ago, when she visited Eliat's dolphin reef.
 
The British rock concert producer immediately had a liking for the mammal, and since then has been visiting the resort several times a year.

Cindy was waiting in the water and after "vows" were exchanged, Sharon was tossed into the water by her friends so that she could swim with her new husband.

"I'm the happiest girl on earth," the bride was cited as saying, "I made a dream come true, and I am not a pervert," she has stressed.
