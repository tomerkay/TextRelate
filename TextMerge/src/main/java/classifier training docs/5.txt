At a public ceremony, Tendler wore a white dress and placed flowers on her head to tie the knot with Cindy, who escorted by his fellow best-men dolphins swam over to his bride.

The Jewish millionaire hugged him, whispered sweet nothings in his ear and kissed him in front of a cheering crowd.

Tendler, a British rock concert producer, met the Dolphin 15 years ago and developed a liking resulting in two to three annual visits every year to spend some time with her underwater love.
